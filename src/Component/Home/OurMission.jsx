                Tur expected to improve in coming days

                  Despite strong fundamental factors, the cash market for tur
                  experienced a slight decline of 1-2% on average. This dip was
                  attributed to a decrease in C&amp;F offers for the Burmese
                  Lemon variety and reduced trading activities due to the
                  festive atmosphere. The C&amp;F offers dropped by $15,
                  reaching $1445 per metric ton at Indian ports during the
                  reviewed week. It is anticipated that tur prices will remain
                  stable, and there might be an increase of INR 200-300 per
                  quintal due to renewed buying interest. This expected rise is
                  influenced by seasonal demand, existing supply constraints,
                  and limited imports from Mozambique due to the Phyto
                  Certification issue.{" "}
                  <span>
                    Tur traded at INR 12,500 per quintal, down by 0.79% in
                    Gulbarga and traded at 11,600 per quintal, down by 2.52% in
                    Indore. However, it traded flat at INR 12,000 per quintal in
                    Latur.

                    prices strengthened by 4-5% on average during the reviewed
                    week. This increase was driven by a significant and sudden
                    rise in C&amp;F offers for both FAQ and SQ varieties,
                    coupled with seasonal demand and a scarcity of high-quality
                    produce. Additionally, the limited imports from Myanmar,
                    resulting from the supply-demand disparity in India for
                    quality crops, further bolstered this bullish momentum.
                    C&amp;F offers for FAQ and SQ varieties surged by $55 for
                    each type, reaching $1140 and $1250 per metric ton
                    respectively, at Indian ports. Looking ahead, superior
                    quality Urad crops are expected to command higher prices due
                    to reduced production and quality-related challenges.
                    Consequently, Urad prices are anticipated to rise by INR
                    100-200 per quintal in the coming days. Urad FAQ traded at
                    INR 9,550 per quintal, up by 5.52% in Mumbai and at INR
                    9,700 per quintal, up by 4.30% in Delhi.

                    During the 2022-23 agricultural season, farmers received
                    price of Rs 2,640 per quintal for common grade paddy and Rs
                    2,660 for grade â€˜Aâ€™ paddy. This payment encompassed the
                    central Minimum Support Price (MSP) range of Rs. 2,040-2,060
                    and an additional bonus of Rs 600 provided by the state
                    government. Approximately 10.75 million metric tons of paddy
                    were procured from 23.4 lakh farmers in the previous
                    marketing year. The ruling political party's leader has
                    promised to increase the purchase price of paddy to Rs 3,600
                    per quintal, alongside promises of a loan waiver and a fifty
                    percent reduction in electricity bills for agricultural
                    labor if the party secures victory in the upcoming state
